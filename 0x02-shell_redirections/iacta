Hello every one!
This is a file i used for alx SE excercise for shell I/O redirection
Hello hello hello
Testing my skills 1,2...
Here we go again.
Let's sing a song called "like you do" by bitterkiss
1,2,3, go!
You, you worry about nothing
That's what i found so crazy about you
You're the one in a million to catch the incurable flu
You see smiles up and down
and wonder why everyon's wearing a smile
.......
Let's end here
Thanks
